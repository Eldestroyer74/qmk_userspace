# Principles for redesigning key map
## Retain finger memory
I already know where a lot of layer modifiers are and I'm familiar with QWERTY. Hence, wherever possible keep those where they are. In particular, try and keep:
- Shfit where it is
- Ctrl in a similar location
- Enter where it is

## Symetrical taps and holds for thumbs
Make it so that the three thumb buttons on the left and the right halfs of the keyboard do the same. This will make it easy to use keycaps with labels for 60% and 65% keyboards. For me personally, it will make it easier to remember as it builds on how I already use my existing keyboards with a single space bar.

## Move/Select words, lines, pages
I'm not a programmer, however a very common interaction that I enjoy is the ability to use arrows, home, end and page up and down with both control to just move the cursor there or with shift. Hence, 

## Focus on memorability of a layer concept over reducing the number of layers. 
The miller principle states the human brain can remember 7 + or - 2 things. Hence, it is better to have 8 very memorable new layers that are easy to use, than 4 that cram everything you want into them.

## Place frequently used keys in the home rows in new layers

## 1 layer, one concept
The shift layer does one thing, makes things caps, (or it access it the symbols on top of the numbers). It makes the purpose of shift easy to remember. In contrast, the windows GUI layer has a lot of shortcuts, but it serves so many purposes that it's hard to remember. Making the user only use it infrequently. Specifically, you may need the following layers:
- Numbers (and Symbols)
- Arrows
- Extremes - Home, Page Up, Page Downd, End
- Modifiers - to multiply

## Layers are ON when held
It's hard to remember whether a layer has been toggled, sure you could look at the keyboard, but his will slow down typing

## The left hand enables the right hand
Layers that we create will be accessed by the space bar (middle thumb button) and the home row on the left and right halves of the keyboard.

## Keep new layers to space bar and home row combos
The old layers (alt, ctrl, shift, gui) should remain where they used to be (if possible), this will reduce the need to learn a new spot, the new layers are then accessed by space bars, and space bar home row keys. This will make the new locations easy to access and over time I'll remember their location.

## Don't double up
I wrote this principle as it would be easy to have a symbols layer, however that layer already exists by pressing the shift and the spacer bar at the same time. The only problem is that they are all in the number pad layout not the top row layer. However, as the left hand must be held to access them, I'll just have to learn where they all are. Note, 7,8,9 remain in the current locaiton, so I should be able to bring that knowldge back into it. 

## Home row modifiers
Make it so that the home row have modifiers.
